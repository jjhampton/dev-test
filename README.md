# Dev Test Prototype

## Live Demo
* http://demo-app.freeiz.com

## Development Hours:
 * ~ 20 hours

## Database information:
* mySQL database created w/ myPHPAdmin with MAMP
* mySQL database created on webhost Cpanel w/ myPHPAdmin

## Database Dumps:
* [Development Database](local-db-demo.sql)
* [Live Demo Database](webhost-db-a3278868_demo.sql)

## Development Plan:
* https://github.com/jjhampton/dev-test/issues/1

## Issues I'd like to improve on / Refactor More:
* I spent a large portion of yesterday writing SCSS code for my various mobile breakpoints aiming to emulate the layout of the .PSD at the different screen sizes.  I found myself reusing some code across some of the media query partials and would like to research various workflows to speed this up and be more DRY.

* This was my first time creating a mySQL database and saving data to it with PHP.  Over the course of three days, I spent a good portion of time researching how to do this. In hindsight, it's relatively easy (and can be accomplished with very little code), but the initial learn took some time.

* I also spent a good amount of time slicing the .PSD comp.  Working with .PSDs is something I aim to improve on and become more efficient at.  I attempted to use Gimp for this task and see this as something I would like to become more skilled at with cleaner slices using the industry standard program (Adobe suite).

* I saved the sticky-nav, lightbox, and diagonal-line hover effect CSS features for last and found that they took a bit more time than I had anticipated.
